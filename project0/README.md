Web Programming with Python and JavaScript


Hello, this project is a little about me.
There are 4 html files:
    - index: a welcome screen with demo of the following techniques: css @mobile, scss nesting, scss inheritance.
        contains: <nav>, <h3>, <p>, <div>, <img>, <li>, <hr>, <footer>, <a href> 
        note, in the NAV bar link [CS50] this goes to: https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-web-programming-with-python-and-javascript
    
    - movie: list of quotes from people I look up to and some of my favorite movies in a table with links to Amazon.
        contains: more of the above with a bootstrap table with links to Amazon.co.uk
    
    - animals: display of my favorite animals, using image tags and mobile responsive.
        contains: bootstrap 3 columns, with <img> attributes.  
    
    - cars: demo an extra bootstrap feature [carousel] with buttons, captions and indicators.
        contains: responsive and interactive photo album of cars.
